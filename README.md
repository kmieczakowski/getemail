Move your emails from Gmail to Google Sheets

Google Apps Script that enables you to transfer email body from specified label to Google Sheets

Once transferred to Google Sheets you can then use it o manage the data and allocate it into columns, rows etc.

For example, our team uses GetEmail to transfer the email body to Google Sheets, to then create an active list of incoming emails that need to be handled by Reps. Separate functions in the Google sheets allocate e-mails to each person in the team on a rota basis, relevant data is extracted from emails and displayed on a separate sheet that everyone in the team can see.

I saw many people looking for a simple solution like that, and I hope some will find it useful.

To use simply copy the code and paste it to your Gogle Apps Script Editor, then edit accordingly and save.

Enjoy working with it and expanding it to suit your needs. Kam
